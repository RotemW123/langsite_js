LangSite
Live Demo: https://sprightly-naiad-33cd57.netlify.app

Please note: The app is deployed on free tiers of Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend), which causes cold starts and slower initial loading.
Additionally, the Python backend for grammar practice exercises is not currently deployed due to free tier limitations, but the code is
available in the repository for local use.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React, React Router, TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js/Express, MongoDB
Language Processing: Python/Flask, spaCy, pymorphy3

Combining my passion for programming and my love for foreign languages, LangSite is a web application designed to help users learn and practice
foreign languages through reading texts, practicing flashcards and completing grammar exercises.
